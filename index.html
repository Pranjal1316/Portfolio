      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am Pranjal Badgujar, a highly motivated and technically skilled software developer with a Master's in Computer Applications. With a consistent academic record (MCA CGPA 9.77, BCA CGPA 9.29), I bring a strong foundation in programming, problem-solving, and full-stack application development.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        My technical toolkit includes Java, Python, C++, PHP, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, and version control with Git/GitHub. I have successfully delivered projects like an Online Shopping Portal, E-Healthcare Appointment System, and a Teacher Record Management System—each built with a focus on clean architecture, responsive design, and performance.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I have a keen interest in software engineering, data structures and algorithms, and enjoy designing scalable, maintainable systems. My approach to development emphasizes clarity, collaboration, and continuous learning. I’m confident working independently or as part of a cross-functional team, and I’m always eager to explore new technologies and frameworks.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Currently, I am looking for a software development role where I can apply my skills to build impactful products, contribute to engineering excellence, and grow within a professional development environment.
